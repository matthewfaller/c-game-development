# Chapter 1, Hello World

Most programmer's first program will be the traditional "Hello, World" program. 

However, there are many, cooler things we could do...

## "printf" - Print with Formatting

Documentation for `printf` can be found [at this link](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/ "click for docs")

### Quick Examples

Simple
```c
printf("My String");
```

```
My String
```

Newline
```c
printf("My String\n");
printf("My Other String");
```

```
My String
My Other String
```

## Practice Problems

### 1. Write a program that outputs the Konami Code to the console. 
> This program must replace arrows with their corresponding  direction. For example, if the first two items in the code were up arrows, you'd output "Up UP".
